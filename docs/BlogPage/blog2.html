      <h3 class="bDate">27 March 2022</h3>
      <article class="postContent2">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        URLs are a fundamental part of how we experience the internet today.
        This piece of writing will guide the reader through the following
        questions: what is an URL, why do we need URLs, who invented URLs, and
        how do they work. Hopefully, this will give the reader some insight into
        the wonderful creation that is the URL, how they work, and its history.
        <h2>1. What is an URL?</h2>
        URL stands for Universal Resource Locator[1][6][8]. Universal, meaning
        this thing can be used by anyone, anywhere. Resource, meaning a set of
        some kind of information existing on the internet. Locator, meaning
        finding where a resource is sitting [1][2].Something that can be used by
        anyone, anywhere to find where a piece of information is sitting on the
        world wide web. In essence, URLs are strings that are used to take users
        to specific sets of information on the web[1][2]. The characters of the
        strings that make up URLs can consist of all the letters of the
        alphabet, plus signs, periods, and hyphens [1]. URLs should be
        interpreted with uppercase and lowercase characters meaning the same
        thing[1]. There are some characters that should not be used lightly when
        making up these strings because they could have a special meaning to the
        URL, these include digits, percentage signs, "<" and ">" and others[1].
        URLs use protocols to know what kind of information is being accessed by
        a particular string[1]. For example, HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer
        Protocol - allowing text and other information to be displayed on a web
        page that can be accessed through a URL[1]. FTP stands for File Transfer
        Protocol, which allows a URL to send a user to files or directories
        stored on the internet. Something important to note is accessibility -
        just because a user has a URL that leads to a web page - does not mean
        that that user can access it [2]. Sometimes, web pages and other
        information on the internet are restricted so that only certain users
        can access them. An URL can definitely allow you to locate where a bit
        of information exists on the internet, but having that URL does not
        automatically grant you access to that information. I could share the
        URL of the private settings section on one of my social media accounts
        with somebody, but just because that person now has the URL to my
        private settings does not mean that they can access it, it will be
        locked by a password. Some URLs can only be accessed if a user is on a
        specific network, and so on and so forth.
        <h2>2. Why do we Need URLs?</h2>
        Imagine a bit of information on the internet is a needle, and you have
        to search for this needle of information in a haystack - but the
        haystack is actually made of billions of other needles, and you need to
        sift through all of them to find the specific needle that you need. A
        URL acts as a clever bit of string that can find and pull your specific
        needle to you - no need to go painfully digging through every needle in
        the stack. (See, I did a clever pun with the word string because URLs
        are strings and you can also pull literal pieces of strings through
        needles.) Before the advent of URLs, if you needed information on the
        internet - the only way to access this information would be to directly
        connect to wherever that information is stored, directly dial your
        device's connection to the specific place on the internet you wanted to
        be, similar to dialing a number on a telephone[4]. Connections could
        only be established if both devices were online and ready to be
        established, in the 1970s it would be impossible to send an email to
        someone if that someone's computer was not online while the email was
        being sent[4]. Thanks to URLs and the advancement of internet
        technologies, we can skip over needing to directly connect to where
        information is being stored to display it, and rather just locate and
        access it through a URL.
        <h2>3. Who Came up with URLs?</h2>
        Tim Berners-Lee invented the URL in 1992[4]. In 1994, Berners-Lee
        released a memo detailing the usage of URLs and how they work[1]. It is
        available on the Internet Engineering Taskforce's website[1]. The
        Internet Engineering Taskforce(IETF), founded in 1986, is an
        organization that promotes the open development of the internet, there
        is no formal membership of this task force, it basically manages the
        general standards of the internet that we use, including things like the
        internet protocols that exist within URLs[7]. The IETF has a heavy
        stance on the openness of information, where all of their documentation,
        all of their resources are very open-source and available to anyone or
        any organization who would like to access them[5].
        <h2>4. How do they Work?</h2>
        We have some information that exists on a network, which is great. Now
        how do we allow others to access this information? How do we allow
        others to access this information freely and without restriction? Here
        is the problem [2]. The solution that we have is an "object" of sorts
        that points to where that information exists. How does this solution
        work exactly? A URL consists of 5 parts that allow a web browser and an
        internet connection to figure out where exactly your information is
        sitting[3]. The first part of the URL is the protocol that it needs to
        use when accessing the web page, the most common one for us is HTTP, it
        tells the URL how that information is being stored, for HTTP it means it
        is a hypertext mark up protocol, which displays websites[3]. The second
        part of the URL is the subdomain, this is the specific page on a webpage
        where the information exists[3]. The third part of the URL is the Second
        Level Doman (SLD) - this is the name of the website usually[3]. The
        fourth part is Top Level Domain - it is an identifier to show what kind
        of organization is running a website, such as .com, .org, .co.za, .gov
        these all describe to the user and the URL who is displaying this
        information[3]. The fifth part is the subdirectory - this shows the user
        which specific part of the website the user is on[3]. A web browser
        takes all these parts of the URL and finds where exactly a piece of
        information is sitting and directs the user to that information. And now
        we know how URLs work[3]. Conclusion Thank you for reading this. We've
        learned some interesting information about how we as users can locate
        and access information on the internet using URLs, as well as a small
        part of the history behind them. Thanks again!
